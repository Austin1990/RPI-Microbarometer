# RPI-Multi-sensor environment monitor
Updated version of the ICP-10125 based microbarometer station using 3 different sensors
- BMP-280 for Temperature & pressure
- SGP30 for VOC & CO₂-eq
- SHT31 for Temperature & humidity

The sensor is interfaced with a Raspberry Pi providing signal processing, saving data in .mseed format, and plotting the data in daily, weekly and rolling 168hours plots.

System has performance of research/professional systems at a fraction of the price. A full rig, premounted sensor and a Raspberry Pi costing approx £70.
