# RPI-Microbarometer
Low cost microbarometer station, 1Pa resolution.
This project complements our infrasound monitor. A microbarometer with approx 1Pa resolution and 0.4Pa noise threshold 
based on the digital ICP-10125 i2c enabled absolute pressure sensor. 

The sensor is interfaced with a Raspberry Pi providing signal processing, saving data in .mseed format, plotting and then uploading plots to a server. 
System has performance of research/professional systems at a fraction of the price. A full rig, premounted sensor and a Raspberry Pi costing approx Â£70.
